Hello, and welcome! 

This guide is intended for module or kernel developers getting started for the first time with the Ara MDK and development hardware. This provides a step-by-step guide to setting up your hardware and computer, and then building and running a set of firmware images that lets you verify everything is working as expected. If you're more experienced, feel free to skip this guide and work your way through the other wiki pages listed in the box at the right, in the order they are listed.

Ready? Here we go!
