This page describes how to load firmware images into flash memory.  Instructions for [[building firmware images|Building-the-Code]] and for [[obtaining prebuilt binaries from Buildbot|Buildbot]] are available.

There are 3 supported scenarios:
* [Load firmware image to SPIROM for a bridge ASIC on BDB](Flashing-images#load-firmware-image-to-spirom)
* [Load firmware image to SVC internal flash on BDB](Flashing-images#load-firmware-image-to-svc-internal-flash-on-bdb)
* [Load firmware image to SVC internal flash on endo](Flashing-images#load-firmware-image-to-svc-on-endo)

####Load firmware image to SPIROM

#####Bridge ASIC debug board connectors and reset switches

The following table shows which connectors (on the BDB) to connect the debug board FPC cable to. You'll need it in later steps.

Bridge ASIC | BDB Debug Connector | Reset Switch 
------------|---------------------|-------------
APB1        | CON17               | SW8
APB2        | CON19               | SW9
APB3        | CON16               | SW7
GPB1        | CON14               | SW5
GPB2        | CON15               | SW6

#####Hardware Setup

The final debug board configuration should look like this. Click the image for a larger version.

1. REMOVE POWER FROM BDB.
2. Connect FPC from BDB debug board connector CON9 to the corresponding bridge ASIC connector on the BDB; the table below lists which BDB connector corresponds to each bridge. The FPC has labels 'side Debug Board' and 'BDB'; you must connect the boards according to those labels.
3. Verify jumper is installed on debug board JP15 pins 1-2
4. Make sure all bridge ASIC reset switches (see table above) are *TOWARDS* pin 1.
5. Connect the Dediprog SF100 8-pin IDC to debug board CON1 "SPI ROM" header. Note, this header is not keyed. Visually ensure that the red wire of the cable aligns with the pin 1 dot and the "M" of "ROM" on the debug board silkscreen.
6. Optional: Connect USB cable to debug board CON6 for bridge serial debug output. Run a terminal program at 115200 baud, 8N1.
7. Apply power to the BDB. 

#####Software Steps

1. The Flashrom utility expects the binary image file to be the same size as the flash device. Run the truncate utility to pad the image to 2M:

   `truncate -s 2M <path-to-nuttx-binary-image>.bin` 
  
2. Run the flashrom utility:

   `flashrom Â --programmer dediprog -w <path-to-nuttx-binary-image>.bin`

   If all goes well, you should see something like the following:

   ```
   flashrom v0.9.7-r1852 on Linux 3.13.0-24-generic (x86_64)
   flashrom is free software, get the source code at
   http://www.flashrom.org
   Calibrating delay loop... delay loop is unreliable, trying to continue
   OK.
   Found Winbond flash chip "W25Q16.W" (2048 kB, SPI) on dediprog.
   [...bunch of blah blah here, omitted for clarity...]
   Reading old flash chip contents... done.
   Erasing and writing flash chip... Erase/write done.
   Verifying flash... VERIFIED.
   ```

   *Note*: If you attempt to reprogram the same image twice, you may see the following output instead:

   ```
   Reading old flash chip contents... done.
   Erasing and writing flash chip...
   Warning: Chip content is identical to the requested image.
   Erase/write done.
   ```

3. Unplug the SF-100. **Leaving it connected when the bridges are taken out of reset can cause hardware damage**.

4. Take all bridges out of reset by moving their reset switches *AWAY* from pin 1.

####Load firmware image to SVC internal flash on BDB
STM32 internal flash is written via the JTAG interface, 
using gdb commands.

#####Hardware Setup

The final debug board configuration should look like this. Click the image for a larger version.

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/projectara/Firmware-wiki/images/Debug-Adapter-Board-Rev-B-Setup.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/projectara/Firmware-wiki/images/Debug-Adapter-Board-Rev-B-Setup.png" width=640/></a>

1. REMOVE POWER FROM BDB
2. Connect JTAG interface to debug board CON3 and host USB
3. Connect FPC from debug board CON9 to BDB CON18. Observe FPC labeling 'side Debug
Board' and 'BDB'. 
4. Verify debug board SW5 is positioned *away* from the SW5 label, to hold the bridge ARM processor in reset while programming.  
5. Verify jumper is installed at debug board JP15 pins 1-2  
6. Optional: USB cable connected to BDB CON12 for debug serial output.  
7. Apply power to BDB

#####Software Steps  
1. Open a terminal window and start the JLink gdbserver, specifying the SVC device:

   `JLinkGDBServer -device STM32F417IG`

2. Open another terminal window and start GDB, passing the nuttx ELF image you want to upload:

   `arm-none-eabi-gdb <path-to-svc-nuttx>`.

   For example, if you used "build_ara_image.sh ara svc/bdb2a" from the NuttX top level directory to build an SVC image for BDB2 (either BDB2A or BDB2B, **note the confusing name**), the BDB2 SVC image is build/ara-svc-bdb2a/image/nuttx.

3. Connect GDB to gdbserver:

   `target remote localhost:2331`

4. Reset target:

   `monitor reset`

5. Load the ELF image into flash memory. It will be stored there permanently (until you next reprogram it).

   `load`

   *Note*: to load the SVC binary image (nuttx.bin), use the 'restore' command instead:

   `restore nuttx.bin binary 0x08000000`

6. Run the ELF image.

   `continue`

   You can use control-C to break execution, set breakpoints, etc. Another `monitor reset` / `continue` will restart the image from its reset vector.

7. You can now disconnect the debug board FPC from the BDB. The SVC firmware image you just flashed will run whenever you power cycle the BDB.

####Load firmware image to SVC on endo

#####Hardware Setup
  
1. REMOVE POWER TO THE ENDO. Power is supplied via USB charger or battery module.  
2. Connect JTAG interface to debug board CON2 (remove masking tape) 
3. Connect FPC from debug board CON9 to Endo (CON??). Observe FPC labeling 'side Debug
Board' and 'BDB'. 'BDB' end goes to Endo.
4. Verify jumper installed at debug board JP14 pins 1-2  
5. Optional: USB cable connected to debug board CON6 for SVC serial console.  
6. Apply power to Endo.
 
#####Software Steps  
1. Open a terminal window and start the JLink gdbserver, specifying the SVC device:

   `JLinkGDBServer -device STM32F417IG`

2. Open another terminal window and start GDB, passing the nuttx ELF image you want to upload:

   `arm-none-eabi-gdb <path-to-svc-nuttx>`.

   An [SVC image binary](http://ara-buildbot.leaflabs.com:8011/images/endo-svc.b4b29bdfc51281dbb30172d8625a2cb2deb51047/nuttx) you can use is available on the Google I/O demo buildbot.

3. Connect GDB to gdbserver:

   `target remote localhost:2331`

4. Reset target:

   `monitor reset`

5. Load the ELF image into flash memory:

   `load`.

   *Note*: to load the SVC binary image (nuttx.bin), use the 'restore' command instead:

   `restore nuttx.bin binary 0x08000000`

6. Run the ELF image.

   `continue`

   You can use control-C to break execution, set breakpoints, etc. Another `monitor reset` / `continue` will restart the image from its reset vector.
