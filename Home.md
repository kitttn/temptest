Welcome to the Project Ara Firmware wiki.

This wiki is the definitive repository for collected knowledge about developing 
firmware for Project Ara. Here, you will find links to project-related documents, 
and details on building, loading, running, and debugging the firmware on Project 
Ara development boards.

If you're brand new to Project Ara firmware development, and you've just received your Big Development Board (BDB) and Jetson TK1 kits, the [Quick Start Guide](Quick-Start-Guide) is just the ticket. 

We're going to be updating this wiki frequently in the coming days,
to capture the latest changes to the development flow and build process,
so check back often.
