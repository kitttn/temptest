Welcome to the Project Ara Firmware wiki.

This wiki is the definitive repository for collected knowledge about developing 
firmware for Project Ara. Here, you will find links to project-related documents, 
and details on building, loading, running, and debugging the firmware on Project 
Ara development boards.

If you're brand new to Project Ara firmware development, and you've just received your Big Development Board (BDB) or Software Development Board (SDB), and your Application Processor kit (AP), the [Quick Start Guide](Quick-Start-Guide) is just the ticket.
